## Project Purpose
1. Conduct a statistical analysis of the Washington state Contributions to Candidates and Political Committees data to look for trends and anomalies.  
2. Visualize the data and generate plots that help explain any insights from the data. 
3. Present the results.

## About the Data  
The Contributions to Candidates and Political Committees dataset was downloaded from [data.wa.gov](https://data.wa.gov/Politics/Contributions-to-Candidates-and-Political-Committe/kv7h-kjyeOpens) and the dataset is in the Public Domain. The description of this dataset from the `data.wa.gov` site states:
  > This dataset contains cash and in-kind contributions made to Washington State Candidates and Political Committees for the last 10 years as reported to the PDC on forms C3, C4, Schedule C and their electronic filing equivalents. It does not include loans, pledges or any expenditures.
For candidates, the number of years is determined by the year of the election, not necessarily the year the contribution was reported. For political committees, the number of years is determined by the calendar year of the reporting period.  
  
  > Candidates and political committees choosing to file under "mini reporting" are not included in this dataset. See WAC 390-16-105 for information regarding eligibility.
This dataset is a best-effort by the PDC to provide a complete set of records as described herewith and may contain incomplete or incorrect information. The PDC provides access to the original reports for the purpose of record verification.  
  
  > Descriptions attached to this dataset do not constitute legal definitions; please consult RCW 42.17A and WAC Title 390 for legal definitions and additional information political finance disclosure requirements.
